MODULE 1: FEATURE ENGINEERING & SELECTION
Working:
Three-stage feature reduction process applied to prevent data leakage and optimize model performance: (1) Analyzed 190 raw features for redundancy via correlation analysis, low-variance detection, and one-hot group identification, (2) Performed 80/20 stratified train-test split BEFORE any feature engineering to ensure zero information leakage, created target-encoded features using only training data statistics, (3) Reduced features from 81 to 50 through time-window consolidation (kept 5d, dropped other variants), domain-based filtering with Random Forest importance verification, and final importance-based ranking, (4) Validated that feature reduction maintained test performance while reducing overfitting.
