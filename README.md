## 🧩 MODULE 1: FEATURE ENGINEERING & SELECTION

### <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6672ee8c-15ed-4fb5-9cd5-63c04ac747c1" height="20px" style="vertical-align:bottom;"> Working:
Three-stage feature reduction process applied to prevent data leakage and optimize model performance:  
1️⃣ Analyzed **190 raw features** for redundancy via correlation analysis, low-variance detection, and one-hot group identification,  
2️⃣ Performed **80/20 stratified train-test split BEFORE any feature engineering** to ensure zero information leakage, created target-encoded features using only training data statistics,  
3️⃣ Reduced features from **81 to 50** through time-window consolidation (kept 5d, dropped other variants), domain-based filtering with Random Forest importance verification, and final importance-based ranking,  
4️⃣ Validated that feature reduction maintained test performance while reducing overfitting.
